How to install Glossword?
From the local computer to a remote hosting

    * Unpack the package glossword-1.x.x.zip to local machine. Use a tool like 7-Zip to extract archive files.
    * Upload the contents of folder /glossword/1.x to a remote hosting.
    * Set writing permissions for folder /glossword/gw_temp and several subfolders. It can be done with any FTP-client software or by the command line:

      # cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/glossword 
      # chmod 0777 gw_temp
      # chmod 0777 gw_temp/t
      # chmod 0777 gw_temp/a
      # chmod 0777 gw_temp/gw_cache_sql
      # chmod 0777 gw_temp/gw_export

    * Set writing permissions for file /db_config.php:

      # chmod 0666 db_config.php

      Index of /usr/local/apache/htdocs/glossword

      *      [DIR] gw_admin        -
      *      [DIR] gw_install      -
      *      [DIR] gw_locale       -
      *      [DIR] gw_temp         0777         drwxrwxrwx
      *      [DIR] gw_xml          -
      *      [DIR] img             -
      *      [DIR] inc             -
      *      [DIR] lib             -
      *      [DIR] templates       -
      *            .htaccess       -
      *            favicon.ico     -
      *            css.php         -
      *            custom_vars.php -
      *            db_config.php   0666         -rw-rw-rw-
      *            gw_admin.php    -
      *            gw_login.php    -
      *            index.php       -
      *            robots.txt      -

    * Now, if your site is www.domain.tld and Glossword is installing into root directory then the link to installation will be http://www.domain.tld/gw_install/. 

Notes:

    * It is possible to use another temporary folder, but it must be readable by web server and it must be additionally set in file /inc/config.inc.php. 

    * chmod levels 0666 and 0777 are required unless your system uses another permissions. For example, if you are using CGIWrap that runs PHP scripts under the UID of the owner of the file, rather than under the UID of the web server, then chmod to 0644 and 0755.
