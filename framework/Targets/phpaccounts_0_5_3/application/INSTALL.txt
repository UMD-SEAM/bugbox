-------------

1. First check The Minimum Requiremets
2. Download and unzip the PHPAccounts package, if you haven't already.
3. Create a database for PHPAccounts on your web server, as well as a MySQL user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.
4. Upload the files to a directory on your webserver - this can me a subfolder or the docroot.
5. Make sure the config.php file is writable by the webserver (chmod 777 /path/to/phpaccounts/config.php)
6. Run the installation script by accessing /installer.php in your favorite web browser.
7. You will be asked to input the database details, and details for your user account
8. You will also need to make the user data directory writable by the webserver (chmod 777 /path/to/phpaccounts/users)
9. And the cache directory aswell (chmod 777 /path/to/phpaccounts/cache)


That's it! PHPaccounts should now be installed.
