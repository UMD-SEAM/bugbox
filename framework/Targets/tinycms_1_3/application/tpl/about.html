<h2>About</h2>
<p>TinyCMS was first released in early 2012, around February 3rd. Since then we've gained quite a few users, many of which have been very supportive of the project. TinyCMS is pretty much a page content management system with a fancy front-end page loader.</p>
<p>We added the final most requested feature in our 1.2 release, the ability to rename page. Goodness knows why it wasn't in 1.0 and 1.1. TinyCMS 1.3 (this version) addresses an annoying little setting in the config file, which if left as default, won't show you any images in the admin panel and doesn't show our design either. Also, 1.3 has vastly improved files in terms of cleanliness. Mainly, in-depth comments explaining what most if not all of the code does, but also the code is layed out nicely and overall improves the look of the source.</p>
<p>Thanks for downloading,<br />Jake.&nbsp;</p>
