      <h3>TinyCMS 1.3 Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks for downloading TinyCMS 1.3, we hope you enjoy it.
      </p>

      <h3>Installing TinyCMS</h3>
      <p>
        To install TinyCMS, upload the files to your server and you're ready to roll. Visit <strong>YourSite.com/admin/</strong> and use the default login details. The default username is <strong>admin</strong>
        and the default password is <strong>pass</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Installing themes/templates</h3>
      <p>
        At this time, we're still creating a great guide for themes. In TinyCMS 1.4, we'll be creating even easier ways to make themes. Check out our <a href="http://tinycms.net/?page=themes" target="_blank">themes page</a>
        for some starters.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Changes to file locations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong style="color:orange;">Note for existing themes</strong>. We've moved the JS files from yoursite.com/js to yoursite.com/admin/js to clean up the directories. If you're using a theme from our website,
        ensure the directories are correct or the site may not work correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        TinyCMS 1.3 addresses an annoying issue with the URLs on new installations. Also, the code has been cleaned and comments have been added. Just compare the 1.2 functions file to the 1.3 functions file,
        1.2 was a mess!
      </p>

      <p>
        1.4 will most likely include an easy way to create new themes, it's pretty easy right now if you know how, but for example some useful classes may come in handy, such as..
        <i>$build->nav;</i> or <i>$build->content</i>
      </p>
