|      AjaXplorer Installation Instructions      |
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS & QUICK INSTALL
 
 To be able to run this system on your webserver, it must have PHP 3 or higher
 running, and you must have an FTP access to upload the files on the server. 
 That's all! No database is needed.
 
 If you want to use it as fast as possible, just change the ADMIN_PASSWORD in 
 the conf/conf.php file and upload on your server. 
 
 Check that the both "files" and "users" folders are both readable and writeable.
 
 | INFO : FOR UPGRADE FROM 2.2 TO 2.2.1
 |  Copy the files in a different folder.
 |  + From the old distrib to the new one, copy the whole content of users/
 | 	+ Backup the basic conf/conf.php file and copy the line with "$available_languages"
 |  + Copy the old conf/conf.php in place of the new one, and update the $available_languages line.
 |  That's it!
 
 For further configuration, read below.
 
 2 CONFIGURATION
 
 After unzipping the file into a local folder on your computer, use a text editor 
 to edit the configuration file located in conf/conf.php
 
 You have to main configuration to change: the $REPOSITORIES variable and all the USERS constants.
 
 2.1 REPOSITORIES 
    
    In AjaXplorer, a repository is a folder that you want to browse/modify with 
    the application. A repository does not have to be inside the ajaxplorer installation 
    folder, since you set it with an absolute path on your server.
    
    You can set as many repositories as you want : you will be able to switch from one to 
    another when logged to AjaXplorer, and you can precisely set rights for each users (see 
    paragraph 2.2) on each repository. Note that repository are really separated, and for 
    example AjaXplorer does not let you copy a file from a repository to another.
    
    By default, the basic repository is set to the "files" folder inside the ajaxplorer 
    installation folder. You can change it to whatever you want, using absolute path 
    like : /home/login/www/location, or /C:/myfolder/ on windows.
    
    Note that a repository does not have to be accessible to the internet, AjaXplorer will 
    work as a "proxy" between your files and the web.
    
 2.2 USERS MANAGEMENT
    
    An evoluted users management system has been developed in AjaXplorer. You are encouraged 
    to use it to secure your data, but it's up to you, you can disable it totally (for example 
    if you are already working in a very secure zone, and don't need any users profiles).
    
    If you are a beginner, just change the ADMIN_PASSWORD variable before uploading on your 
    server everything should be fine. If you do not change it, you will be reminded to change 
    the first time you log in, because otherwise anybody knowing AjaXplorer could login with 
    the standard initial password "admin"...
    
    You can add / modify / delete users by logging in AjaXplorer as "admin" and clicking on 
    "Settings" button. For each user, you will be able to give read and/or right access separately 
    on each repository. Note that a user that has no rights on any repository cannot log in.
    
    For a better integration in existing systems, AjaXplorer can "prelog" a user from external 
    data or logging system. Users must still be created in AjaXplorer, since their rights on 
    repositories and preferences are stored by the application. But they will not be able to 
    change their password, since they are in that case managed by an external application.
    
    2.2.1 CONFIGURATION
    	
    	ENABLE_USERS => 1 	Users management is enabled
    					0 	Users management is totally disabled. No logging required and all 
    						users share the same preferences.
    					
    	ALLOW_GUEST_BROWSING => 1 	In the "Settings" console accessed by admin user, 
    								a "guest" user is created on which you can set 
    								rights on repositories like any other user. This 
    								user will be automatically logged in if no user 
    								is identified.
    							0 	When no user is identified, the login screen appears 
    								and no repository is loaded.
    								
    	AUTH_MODE => "ajaxplorer" Default value, Ajaxplorer is doing all the work.
    	
    				 "local_http" If you already use some ".htaccess" file for http 
    				 			authentication in the zone where AjaXplorer will be installed, 
    				 			AjaXplorer can retrieve the current logged user directly when 
    				 			loading, avoiding the user to log him self again.
    				 	
    				 "remote" 	If a standard scenario would be that users come from another 
    				 			server of yours on which they are logged, you can pass a session 
    				 			identifier to AjaXplorer and configure it to ask a remote server for 
    				 			the current user logged id. (cf 2.2.3)
    				 			
    2.2.3 REMOTE LOGGING
    
    	Here is how to configure the REMOTE_ config variables for asking a remote server the 
    	current user logged.
    	
    	AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_SERVER => 	The host to request. 
    								For example "www.yourdomain.com"
    								
		AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_URL 	=> 	The url to request on host. The script should take a 
									session_id (or any identifier you want) as a GET variable 
									in input and output a user login in its response.
									For example /public/yourscript.php" or "logger.jsp". 
									
		AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_USER 	=> 	Http Authentication login on remote host.
									Leave blank if not needed.
									
		AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_PASSWORD =>Http Authentication password on remote host.
									Leave blank if not needed.
									
		AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_PORT 	=> 	Http Port to use
		
		AUTH_MODE_REMOTE_SESSION_NAME => Name of the variable in the GET query that will 
										 contain your session id. 
										 For example "session_id".
		
		Once this is properly configured, you can append the ajaxplorer url with the query string
		 "?remote_session=YOURSESSIONID" and ajaXplorer will call your script with "session_id=YOURSESSIONID" 
		 to check if a user is logged.

 2.3 FURTHER CONFIGURATION   
 
	. $dft_langue		=> 		Default language to use, please use "en" or "fr" for the moment.
